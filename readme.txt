The procedure makes use of a decomposable time series model with three main model components: trend, seasonality, and holidays.

y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + e(t)

g(t) trend models non-periodic changes; linear or logistic
s(t) seasonality represents periodic changes; i.e. weekly, monthly, yearly
h(t) ties in effects of holidays; on potentially irregular schedules â‰¥ 1 day(s)
The error term e(t) represents any idiosyncratic changes which are not accommodated by the model; later we will make the parametric assumption that e(t) is normally distributed
